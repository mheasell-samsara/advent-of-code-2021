Part 1 of this one can be solved easily without any code.

The only axis that matters is the Y axis.

To reach max. height we want to launch as fast as possible in Y.

Any upward velocity will eventually cause the projectile
to reach y=0 with vy = -initial_vy - 1.
On the next step the projectile will move down again into the box.

To maximize initial_vy we want to hit the bottom of the box.

In the input, the bottom of the box is y=-85.
Therefore our initial_vy should by +84.

Since rate of y increase is decreasing by 1 every tick,
we can find max. y via triangle number formula (n*(n+1))/2

(84*85)/2 = 3570
