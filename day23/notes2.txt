Holy shit my code for this one sucks.
Highly complex, full of bugs, and slow.
The A* could be much faster with a min-heap of course
but there is probably something key I missed
that would cut down the search space a lot.
I spent way too long on this one and got punished hard
for my unwillingness to write unit tests.
