Boy what a horrendous puzzle.

My solution is really slow.
It could be a lot faster, I reckon,
if my indexing was smarter.
For example, create an index using the edges as the keys, 
so that you can search for matching edges (and their associated points) directly
using the index rather than having to go through every
single point in the other region and check its edges/neighbours set.
